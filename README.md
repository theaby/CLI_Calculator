# CLI_Calculator
This will be a CLI Calculator application which accepts two numbers and an action to perform. The output will be to restate the equation and the answer in a readable format. I will use the Try/Except in an infinite loop to continually ask for a value until it is valid.

# Useage
When you run the application, you will be given instructions on the first two lines and then you will be asked for the "First Number".
If you enter in a non-number, you will be informed "That is an invalid number, let's try again."
You will then be asked for the "First Number" again.
This will continue until valid input is provided.

Next you will be asked for the "Action(+, -, /, or *: )
If you enter in a value is in NOT [+, -, /, *], you will be asked to enter in one of those values.
Like the "Fist Number" request, this will continue until value input is provided.

Next you will be asked for the "Second Number" to complete the equation.
If you enter in a non-number, you will be informed "That is an invalid number, let's try again."
You will then be asked for the "Second Number" again.
This will continue until valid input is provided.

Once you have successfully completed the input of the three requests, the application will print out the equation and the answer.
Application will end and put you back to the CLI.
